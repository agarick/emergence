* emergence

** About

*Emergence* is a visualiser and processor of a primordial particle system and its emergent/interactive properties.

This project is based on the article, /How a life-like system emerges from a simple particle motion law/, by  Schmickl, Stefanec, and Crailsheim: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969.

This is a rewrite of https://github.com/agarick/mff/tree/master/emergence, which was coded in JavaScript + HTML5 and runs on the web browser. The present project uses OpenGL (graphics), OpenCL (parallelisation), GLFW (windowing), ImGui (user interface), and C++ as the main language of implementation. It runs as a native desktop application.

** Build & Run
