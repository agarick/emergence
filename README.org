* emergence

** About

*Emergence* is a visualiser and processor of a primordial particle system and its emergent properties.

This project is based on the article, /How a life-like system emerges from a simple particle motion law/, by  Schmickl, Stefanec, and Crailsheim: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969, and extends it with parallel computation and three-dimensionality.

This is a rewrite of an [[https://github.com/agarick/mff/tree/master/emergence][earlier version in JavaScript + HTML5]] which ran via web browser and Node.js. The present project uses OpenGL + GLEW (graphics), OpenCL (parallelisation), glm (math), GLFW (windowing), ImGui (user interface), and C++ as the main language of implementation. It runs as a native desktop application.
