** About

*Emergence* is a visualiser and processor of a primordial particle system.

This project is based on the article, /How a life-like system emerges from a simple particle motion law/, by  Schmickl, Stefanec, and Crailsheim: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969, and extends it with our own [[https://zool33.uni-graz.at/artlife/pps_3d][version of three-dimensionality]].

This is a rewrite and extension of an [[https://github.com/blobject/mff/tree/master/emergence][earlier JavaScript + HTML5 version]] which ran via web browser and Node.js. The present project uses OpenGL + GLEW (graphics), glm (math), GLFW (windowing), ImGui (user interface), OpenCL (parallelisation), and C++ (implementation language). It runs as a native desktop application on Linux (Xorg).

** Build & Run

*** Dependencies

- clang++ ~>= 11~
- cmake ~>= 3.19~
- glew ~>= 2.2~
- glfw ~>= 3~
- glm ~>= 0.9.9~
- imgui (source & headers provided in =opt/=)
- opengl ~>= 3.3~

**** Optional

- opencl c/c++ headers ~>= 2~
- opencl loader (aka. ocl-icd) ~>= 2~
- opencl runtime ~>= 2.1~
  - Per your graphics card manufacturer, eg. [[https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html][Intel]], [[https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl][Nvidia]], AMD ([[https://www.amd.com/en/search?keyword=amdgpu-pro][link]], [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53070673/download-opencl-amd-app-sdk-3-0-for-windows-and-linux][link]], [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMDGPU_PRO][link]]).
  - This project has only been tested using Intel Graphics Compute Runtime (aka. NEO) for OpenCL for Intel gen9 graphics on Linux.

*** Linux (Xorg) with Intel gen9 graphics

- First, install NEO ::
- Refer to https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime.
- If possible, install the necessary packages via your distribution's package manager.
- Otherwise:
  1. Download the =deb= assets from their [[https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases][releases page]].
  1. Extract the libraries from the =deb= files, and place them under, say, =/usr/local=.
  1. Make sure =ld.so.conf= recognises the directory holding the new libraries, for instance =/usr/local/lib=.
  1. =sudo ldconfig=, substituting renamed copies of library files with symlinks if =ldconfig= complains.
  1. Make sure the path to the new OpenCL driver (eg. =/usr/local/lib/intel-opencl/libigdrcl.so=) is recognised under =/etc/OpenCL/vendors=.
  1. Check that your device is recognised and ready, using a program like =clinfo=.

- Build ::
1. Retrieve this repository from https://github.com/blobject/emergence.
1. ~cd emergence~
1. Optionally configure =DPI= and =CL= in CMakeLists.txt.
1. ~rm -R build; mkdir build; cd build~
1. ~cmake ..~
1. ~make~

*Note:* If any OpenCL component was (un)installed after an invocation of =cmake=, make sure to remove =build/= and do a clean =cmake= again.

- Test ::
1. ~cd emergence/build~
1. ~./testemergence~

- Run ::
1. ~cd emergence/build~
1. ~./emergence~ (append =-h= for usage help)
  - On Intel graphics, turn vsync off to get better performance: ~vblank_mode=0 ./emergence~

** Misc.

- ~4600 lines of (code + comments)
